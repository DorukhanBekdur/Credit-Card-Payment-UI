# Credit Card Payment UI

This project is a credit card payment interface built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The user interface simulates a real-world credit card payment form where users can input their card details. As users fill in the form fields, the details dynamically update on the visual representation of the card at the top of the form.

Features
1) Dynamic Card Update: The credit card displayed on the UI dynamically updates as the user inputs their card number, cardholder name, expiration date, and CVV.
2) Card Flip Animation: When the user hovers over the CVV input field, the credit card flips to show the back side, prompting the user to enter their CVV.
3) Responsive Design: The design is responsive and works on various screen sizes, ensuring a smooth user experience across devices.

Technologies Used
1) HTML: The structure of the UI is built using HTML.
2) CSS: Styling and animations, including the card flip effect, are implemented using CSS.
3) JavaScript: JavaScript handles the dynamic updates of the card information and the interactivity of the card flip effect.
